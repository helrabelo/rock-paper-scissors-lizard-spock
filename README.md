Rock–paper–scissors (also known as scissors-paper-rock or other  variants) is a hand game usually played between two people, in which  each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an  outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a  flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle  finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the  two-fingered V sign (aka "victory" or "peace sign") except that it is  pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air. A  simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes: a draw,  or a win for one player and a loss for the other.
